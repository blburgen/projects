        <p>The unusual data (your puzzle input) consists of many reports, one report per line. Each report is a 
            list of numbers called levels that are separated by spaces.</p>
        <p>The engineers are trying to figure out which reports are safe. The Red-Nosed reactor safety systems 
            can only tolerate levels that are either gradually increasing or gradually decreasing. So, a report 
            only counts as safe if both of the following are true:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.</li>
            <li>Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The engineers are surprised by the low number of safe reports until they realize they forgot to tell 
            you about the Problem Dampener.</p>
        <p>The Problem Dampener is a reactor-mounted module that lets the reactor safety systems tolerate a single 
            bad level in what would otherwise be a safe report. It's like the bad level never happened!</p>
